# Parallel-Computing-and-Algorithms
This repository contains assignments, lecture and supplementary files of Parallel Computing and Algorithms(X033537) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The course description as follows:

This course introduces various parallel programming paradigms, algorithms, and architectures, including some hands-on parallel programming on shared-memory and message-passing parallel architectures. The course aims to help students understand conceptually what parallel computing systems are, what they do, and how they are designed and constructed. Students who registered the course will learn different parallel languages and an ability to parallelize a sequential application using MPI and OpenMP.

The textbook is Parallel Programming in C with MPI and OpenMP by Michael J. Quinn. The folders with numbers are exercises from this book.
