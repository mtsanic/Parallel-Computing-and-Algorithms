# Matrix-Vector Multiplication

This is a exercise of column-wise matrix vector multiplication that description is provided in page 212 of the textbook. The question is given as in the below:

Write a matrix-vector program in which matrices are distributed among the processes in block-column fashion and vectors are replicated. You may assume both matrix and vector are input from a data file, using the same format as described for the example programs in this chapter. At the end of the program execution, vector c should be replicated.
